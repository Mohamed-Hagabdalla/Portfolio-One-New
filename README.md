## Testing

The navigation bar on the top right hand corner of the website was tested to ensure each link navigated to the correct webpage. There were 3 links and each one navigates to a different page. Each link navigates to its intended page with no problems. The social media links, located at the bottom of each webpage, also navigate to their own sites with no issues.

## Validator Testing

To ensure the HTML and CSS codes ran smoothly and had no errors, they were both tested for validation. Testing for each code and more information on how they were tested are explained below in more detail.
